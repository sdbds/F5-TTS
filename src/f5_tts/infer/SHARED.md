# Shared Model Cards

<!-- omit in toc -->
### **Prerequisites of using**
- This document is serving as a quick lookup table for the community training/finetuning result, with various language support.
- The models in this repository are open source and are based on voluntary contributions from contributors.
- The use of models must be conditioned on respect for the respective creators. The convenience brought comes from their efforts.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### **Welcome to share here**
- Have a pretrained/finetuned result: model checkpoint (pruned best to facilitate inference, i.e. leave only `ema_model_state_dict`) and corresponding vocab file (for tokenization).
- Host a public [huggingface model repository](https://huggingface.co/new) and upload the model related files.
- Make a pull request adding a model card to the current page, i.e. `src\f5_tts\infer\SHARED.md`.
